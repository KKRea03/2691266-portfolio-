            <h3>Latest project</h3>
            <p>I recently worked on a web application that helps users track their fitness goals. The app includes features such as workout logging, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations based on user data. I used React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, and it has been well-received by users for its intuitive design and functionality.
